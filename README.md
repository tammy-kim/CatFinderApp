# CatFinderApp
## What is CatFinderApp?

In CatFinderApp, you can find a list of the cat breeds that meet your requirements: 
- whether you want it to be a shorthair or longhair,
- if the cat should be active or calm in nature, 
- if the cat's grooming requirements should be low, 
- if the cat should be friendly to people and other animals, 
- whether you want the cat to be independent or not, 
- if the cat is expected to be healthy (few or no genetic problems), 
- if the cat should produce less protein Fel d 1 and dander (hypoallergenic breed)

I strongly recommend this application to anyone who wants to get a cat but is unsure of which types of cats are right for them!


## What inspired me to do this project?

I'm a cat lover! Cat is my favourite animal. However, I have cat allergies, meaning that I can't just raise any kind of cat without 
risking my health. Then, I found out that there are several hypoallergenic cat breeds out there, and many people with allergies 
do quite well with them. So I decided to make a CatFinder application that provides all the recommended cat breeds for a user.

After making this application, I decided to answer the questionaire and find out what types of cats I should consider getting, and the results said that the Siberian is the only breed that meets my requirements. It looks like I'll be raising a Siberian in the future!

## How does CatFinderApp work?

First, the user must appropriately answer the given questions. For example, it may look like this when the user is done with answering:

Next, after pressing submit button, a new window will pop up that shows all cat breeds that match with the user's responses:

If the user clicks on the button of the cat that they want to learn more about, a new window will pop up that shows the cat's image and short description:
